# House_Price_Prediction
It is purely Done on Python.

House price prediction is a common and important machine learning task that involves using data to predict the prices of residential properties based on various features or attributes. This task is particularly relevant in the real estate industry, as it can help buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals make informed decisions. Here is a description of the house price prediction task in machine learning:

Objective:
The main objective of house price prediction in machine learning is to develop a predictive model that can estimate the market value or selling price of a residential property based on a set of relevant features. These features can include factors such as the size of the house, number of bedrooms, location, neighborhood characteristics, year built, and more.

Data Collection:
To build a house price prediction model, you need a dataset that contains historical information about houses, including their prices and the corresponding features. This dataset can be collected from various sources, including real estate databases, websites, or public records. The dataset should ideally cover a wide range of properties to train a robust model.

Data Preprocessing:
Data preprocessing is a critical step in preparing the dataset for machine learning. This involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, normalizing or scaling numerical features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets to assess the model's performance.

Feature Engineering:
Feature engineering involves selecting and creating relevant features that can help the model make accurate predictions. This may include extracting meaningful information from existing features or combining them in a useful way. For example, creating a feature that represents the ratio of the number of bedrooms to the total square footage.

Model Selection:
Choosing an appropriate machine learning algorithm is a crucial step. Various regression algorithms are commonly used for house price prediction, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and more. The choice of the algorithm depends on the dataset size, complexity, and the need for interpretability.

Model Training:
The selected machine learning model is trained on the training dataset, which involves learning the relationship between the features and house prices. The model adjusts its parameters to minimize the difference between predicted and actual prices.

Model Evaluation:
The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) to assess how well it predicts house prices on the testing dataset.

Hyperparameter Tuning:
To improve the model's performance, hyperparameter tuning may be performed to find the best set of hyperparameters for the chosen algorithm.

Deployment:
Once a satisfactory model is built, it can be deployed for real-world use, such as predicting house prices for new properties that come on the market.

Continuous Monitoring and Maintenance:
Real estate markets are dynamic, and house prices can change over time. Therefore, it's essential to continuously monitor and update the model as new data becomes available to ensure its accuracy and relevance.

House price prediction in machine learning is a valuable tool for various stakeholders in the real estate industry, including homebuyers, sellers, real estate agents, and property investors, to make informed decisions based on data-driven insights.
